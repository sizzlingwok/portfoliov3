                as a subreddit with close to 300,000 members. Recognizing the
                potential for improvement, I believe the development of a
                dedicated mobile app would not only streamline the buying and
                selling experience, but also unlock a plethora of new features
                that were previously hindred by the traditional scope of
                Reddit's functionality."
