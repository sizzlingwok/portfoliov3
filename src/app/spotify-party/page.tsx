                  his friends. He recently found out about the group session
                  feature Spotify implemented. He likes the idea of such
                  feature, but finds it tedious to constantly invite his friends
                  through links to listen along with him. He wishes there was a
                  better invitation system in place so he can continue to invite
                  the same friends to his sessions."

                  feature, I created Spotify Party to explore innovative designs

                  copying album cover arts and track information, which
                  prolonged the design phase. Reflecting on this, I realize I
                  could have streamlined the process by reusing assets and
                  focusing more on functional aspects to expedite project
                  completion."
